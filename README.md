# PIXITextInputUpdated
PIXI.TextInput plugin by Mwni, updated for PIXIv7 and node modules

# Disclaimer
For disclosure, full credit goes to Mwni on Github (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mwni/PIXI.TextInput). They wrote all the code, I just poorly updated it for PIXIv7 and NodeJS module support.

# How to use
Import by:
```
import {TextInput} from 'pixitextinputupdated';
```

Then, you have to initialise it with PIXI's namespace when PIXI has been loaded, like so:
```
PIXI.TextInput = TextInput(PIXI);
```
Or you could do it another way, your choice.
